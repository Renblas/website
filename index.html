			<h2><b>About Me</b></h2>

			<br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
				Hello, I'm Caleb. I am freshman CS major at UCF and a memeber of the Burnett Honors College. In my free
				time I like to throw myself into projects I know I am incompetent at just so I can learn new things.
				This website is one of such projects.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I also use arch btw.

			<h2><b>About This Website</b></h2>
			<br>

			<p>
				This website is a personal project and is VERY work in progress.
				It's purposees are as follows:
			<ul>
				<li>&emsp13; 1) Serve as documentation for various personal projects </li>
				<li>&emsp13; 2) Host files/configs for above projects</li>
				<li>&emsp13; 3) Give me the bragging rights that come with having a website</li>
			</ul>
			</p>

			<br>
			<p style="text-indent: 2em;">
				This website is running on an old windows 8 turned ubuntu server pc running at my house. If you
				experience
				exorbitant amounts of lag, this is why. AT&T residential doesn't really have the upload speeds needed
				for this to work optimally. I also have all of the code for this on my github in case anyone wants to
				look
				at some horrendous css abuses.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Disclaimer: I realize that revealing all of this info is not really wise in terms of security but I'll
				take the gamble. I also am not storing anything of value on this server and any attack will only
				increase my knowledge of cyber security. Just don't mail me a pipe bomb<br>
				To quote Kelly Clarkson, "<i>What doesn't kill you makes you stronger</i>"
